                    Shell is a kernel system and many wonderous things can be done from the shell.Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell. Redirection allows commands’ file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to.

"Fibonacci Sequence" redirects here. For the chamber ensemble, see Fibonacci Sequence (ensemble).A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21.
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn , form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence.

For example, a user wants to buy a bag online, so he/she has to first enter their shipping address in the address form and then add their payment details in the payment form to place an order.

Forms are created by placing input fields within paragraphs, preformatted text, lists and tables. This gives considerable flexibility in designing the layout of forms.                 </p>
